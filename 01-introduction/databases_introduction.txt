1. What data types do each of these values represent?

"A Clockwork Orange" - Text/String
42 - Integer
09/02/1945 - Date
98.7 - Float
$15.99 - Currency/Float

2. Explain in your own words when a database might be used. Explain when a text file might be used.

A database is used whenever data within an application needs to be stored for later use & to be 
retrieved or manipulated throughout the lifecycle of that application and beyond. A text file 
might be used when you just need to store some simple data that is human readable.

3. Describe one difference between SQL and other programming languages.

Due to the fact that SQL is a declarative language, we don’t have to define algorithms in order to 
work with the database. We simply write a declarative statement, or query, and the database 
determines the most efficient way to return the queried data. Also, interestingly, SQL uses a 
single = to check for equality, instead of == as in most other programming languages.

4. In your own words, explain how the pieces of a database system fit together at a high level.

Using databases allows us to store, retrieve and manipulate data through an interface throughout the 
lifecycle of an application and beyond. Through the persistent nature of databases, it allows us to 
manipulate and add to this data over time. By using databases, it allows us to categorize data based 
upon it’s theme i.e movie times, user profile info, and keep them organized using columns and rows. 
Using columns and rows helps to provide us with context for the values contained in each cell of the table.

5. Explain the meaning of table, row, column, and value.

-> The table is the overall structure of the data, it is essentially the ‘housing’ for the rows/columns 
of data and usually represents the overall ‘theme’ of the data. i.e Users, Customers, Movies etc.

-> A row represents one complete unit of data, this could be a purchase, or a user profile, but the row 
represents all the necessary values associated with that one unit of data.

-> A column is the vertical structure of the table, which provides context, via use of labels, as to what 
all the data in each vertical column represents. 

-> A value, or essentially a ‘cell’ of the table, represents one specific value from the table where a row 
and column intersect. Due to this intersection it will give the value context by not only showing which 
category, but also which id it belongs to.

6. List 3 data types that can be used in a table.

Strings, Integer, Float

7. Given this payments table, provide an English description of the following queries and include their results:

     SELECT date, amount
     FROM payments;

This query is simply asking to select & return all the data values stored in both the date AND amount columns 
from the payments table. This would yield the following results: 

date	amount
2016-05-01	1500
2016-05-10	37
2016-05-15	124.93
2016-05-23	54.72

———————————————————————————————————————

     SELECT amount
     FROM payments
     WHERE amount > 500;

This query is asking to select & return all the values from the amount column within the payments table, but 
only where the amount value is greater than 500. This would yield the following results: 

amount
1500

———————————————————————————————————————

     SELECT *
     FROM payments
     WHERE payee = 'Mega Foods';

This query is asking to select & return all the value within that specific row (using the * operator to select 
all the columns in that row), where the value of payee is equal to ‘Mega Foods’. This would yield the following results: 

date	payee	amount	memo
2016-05-15	Mega Foods	124.93	Groceries

———————————————————————————————————————


8. Given this users table, write SQL queries using the following criteria and include the output:

The email and sign-up date for the user named DeAndre Data.

SELECT email, signup
FROM users
WHERE name = 'DeAndre Data';

email	signup
datad@comcast.net	2008-01-20

———————————————————————————————————————


The user ID for the user with email 'aleesia.algorithm@uw.edu'.

SELECT userid
FROM users
WHERE email = 'aleesia.algorithm@uw.edu';

userid
1

———————————————————————————————————————

All the columns for the user ID equal to 4.

SELECT *
FROM users
WHERE userid = 4;

userid	name	email	signup
4	Brandy Boolean	bboolean@nasa.gov	1999-10-15

1. Write out a generic SELECT statement.

SELECT title, releasedate FROM albums WHERE releasedate > 1990;

2. Create a fun way to remember the order of operations in a SELECT statement, such as a mnemonic.

S - Someone
F - Free
W - Willy!

3. Given this dogs table, write queries to select the following pieces of data:
- Display the name, gender, and age of all dogs that are part Labrador.

SELECT name, gender, age FROM dogs WHERE breed LIKE '%labrador%';

- Display the ids of all dogs that are under 1 year old.

SELECT id FROM dogs WHERE age < 1;

- Display the name and age of all dogs that are female and over 35lbs.

SELECT name, age FROM dogs WHERE gender = 'F' AND weight > 35;

- Display all of the information about all dogs that are not Shepherd mixes.

SELECT * FROM dogs WHERE breed NOT LIKE '%shepherd%';

- Display the id, age, weight, and breed of all dogs that are either over 60lbs or Great Danes.

SELECT id, age, weight, breed FROM dogs WHERE weight > 60 OR breed = 'great dane';


4. Given this cats table, what records are returned from these queries?
- SELECT name, adoption_date FROM cats;

Both name AND adoption_date colums for every row of data in the cats table:
name	adoption_date
Mushi	2016-03-22
Seashell	(null)
Azul	2016-04-17

5. From the cats table, write queries to select the following pieces of data.
- Display all the information about all of the available cats.

SELECT * FROM cats;

- Display the name and sex of all cats who are 7 years old.

SELECT name, gender FROM cats WHERE age = 7;

- Find all of the names of the cats, so you don’t choose duplicate names for new cats.

SELECT name FROM cats;


6. List each comparison operator and explain, in your own words, when you would use it. Include a real world example for each.
If you can’t list these from memory, do these flashcards until you can!

< Less than - to compare two values and check which one was smaller/larger e.g. WHERE age < 30
> Greater than - to compare two values and check which one was smaller/larger e.g. WHERE weight > 150
<= Less than, or equal to. - to compare two values and check whether one is less than OR equal to another. e.g WHERE age <= 60
>= Greater than or equal to. - to compare two values and check whether one is greater than OR equal to another e.g WHERE age >= 21
!= not equal to. - to check if two values are NOT equal to one another e.g. WHERE id != 22
<> not equal to. - to check if two values are NOT equal to one another e.g. WHERE id != 22


7. From the cats table, what data is returned from these queries?
- SELECT name FROM cats WHERE gender = ‘F’;

All data in the name column of the cats table where the gender is equal to female:
